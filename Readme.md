Just me making a top-down shooter based on Eli Cuaycong's fantastic video on how to make one. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HycyFNQfqI0)

Shouldn't have any additional dependencies as far as I know, just run and play on both Windows and Linux. Would like to export to MacOS, but I keep getting an error I don't know how to fix, I'll deal with that later.

Will add source code when I figure out how to add entire directories including subdirectories to GitHub, I honestly have no idea how to do that at current.
